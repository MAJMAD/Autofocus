# Autofocus Semicon West 2022



The Autofocus Semicon West 2022 demo system highlights the sqeed and precision supported by both piezo and voice coil mechanics. It showcases an extended range of motion uncommon for piezo systems with the P-725.8CDE2 and an even large range of motion with the V-308, a multi-purpose single axis system designed for hyper compatibility with applications calling for it's use as an X, Y, or Z axis system. It expands upon the previous autofocus demo systems, including the V-308 as an additional second Z-axis and utilizes an X-axis C-413.2GA/V-528.1AA controller mechanics pair rather than the prior C-891/V-408 pair, allowing for further expansion in the future to include a Y-axis controlled by the same C-413.2GA unit.

As implemented, the Autofocus Semicon West 2022 demo system offers an algorithmic approach to automating the determination of an optimal Z position for viewing any planar fields with a precision to 1% of the total travel range of each Z-axis stage, 8um and 70um respectively. This level of precision is not limited to these levels by the system mechanics nor the system algorithm, and these factors of the system can be leveraged to provide levels of precision that fully utilize the system mechanic's sub nanometer resolution. The system limitation is its ability to handle the computational intensity of its algorithm, which is managed by a PIPython program running on a Raspberry Pi 4B, which was chosen as a system host device for its readily deployable characteristics rather than computational power.
